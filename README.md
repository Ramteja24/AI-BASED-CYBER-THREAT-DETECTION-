🔐 AI-Based Cyber Threat Detection
📌 Overview

Cybersecurity threats like brute force, SQL injection, XSS, and DDoS attacks are evolving at a rapid pace, often bypassing traditional rule-based security systems. This project focuses on developing an AI-powered Cyber Threat Detection System that analyzes network traffic in real-time, detects anomalies, and classifies potential cyber threats using machine learning techniques.

Our system is designed to detect both known attacks and zero-day (unknown) threats, providing a scalable and intelligent approach to modern cyber defense.

🚀 Key Features

Real-Time Monitoring – Continuously analyzes network traffic to detect unusual patterns.

AI/ML Threat Detection – Uses supervised and unsupervised models to identify cyber threats.

Anomaly Detection – Detects zero-day attacks through pattern deviations.

Threat Classification – Identifies attack types (Brute Force, SQL Injection, XSS, DDoS, etc.).

Automated Alerts – Generates alerts when suspicious activity is detected.

Dashboard – A web-based dashboard for monitoring threats, logs, and statistics.

🏗️ System Architecture

Data Collection – Capture live network traffic (e.g., using packet sniffers or logs).

Preprocessing – Clean and normalize data for ML model input.

Feature Extraction – Extract relevant features (IP, ports, packet size, frequency, etc.).

Machine Learning Models –

Supervised learning for known attack detection.

Anomaly detection for unknown threats.

Threat Classification & Alerts – Categorize attacks and generate alerts.

Dashboard Interface – Visualize detected threats, statistics, and system performance.

📈 Example Use Case

Network traffic is captured and sent to the AI engine.

The system extracts features and analyzes them using ML models.

A suspicious SQL injection attempt is detected.

The dashboard displays the threat, along with source IP and timestamp.

Automated alert is generated for security admins.

🔮 Future Enhancements

Integration with SIEM systems for enterprise-level deployment.

Adding deep learning models (RNNs, LSTMs) for sequential traffic analysis.

Threat response automation (blocking malicious IPs in real-time).

Cloud deployment for scalable monitoring.
